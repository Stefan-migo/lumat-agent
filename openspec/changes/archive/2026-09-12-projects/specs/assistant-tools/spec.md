# Delta for assistant-tools

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: AT-4 — Typed project tools

The assistant registry MUST expose typed agent-owned project tools for `list`, `find`, `create`, `rename`, `archive`, and `merge`, each with explicit read/write classification and bounded arguments. Dispatch MUST enforce the assistant whitelist immediately before service execution.

#### Scenario: Exact project read
- GIVEN an allow-listed `project.find` request with an exact slug
- WHEN dispatch executes it
- THEN the matching project is returned without approval or mutation

#### Scenario: Lifecycle tool classification
- GIVEN an allow-listed rename, archive, or merge request
- WHEN its schema is inspected
- THEN it is classified as a write and cannot execute as a read

### Requirement: AT-5 — Project approval boundary

Semantic project ambiguity MUST produce bounded candidates and an approval request containing the candidate payload's SHA-256 digest and 15-minute TTL. Namespace selection MUST occur only after SDB `APPROVE`; lifecycle mutations MUST require the same exact-payload approval. The assistant MUST NOT silently reuse or create a project.

#### Scenario: Semantic ambiguity
- GIVEN `project.find` has no exact slug and multiple plausible purposes
- WHEN the tool is called
- THEN it returns an approval-required result and selects no namespace

#### Scenario: Approved mutation
- GIVEN an exact approved rename or merge payload
- WHEN SDB `APPROVE` is consumed
- THEN the typed service executes once; absent, expired, or changed approval performs no mutation
