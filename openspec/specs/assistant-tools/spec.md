# assistant-tools Specification

## Purpose

Expose bounded typed native tools over existing domain services, with safe automation writes and evidence.

## Requirements

### Requirement: AT-1 — Typed Domain Tool Registry

The assistant MUST expose typed, exact-argument tools for read access to customers, conversations, appointments, cases, knowledge base, memory/KPIs, and web search. Each tool MUST declare its read/write classification and MUST call domain services directly, never panel HTTP routes.

#### Scenario: Valid read
- GIVEN an authorized plan with a valid typed read tool and arguments
- WHEN the tool executes
- THEN the corresponding service result is returned as evidence without a write

#### Scenario: Invalid or undeclared tool
- GIVEN a tool name or argument shape outside the registry
- WHEN execution is requested
- THEN validation rejects it before any service call

### Requirement: AT-2 — Confirmed Automation Write

The automation creation tool MUST be classified as a write, MUST execute only after exact approval, and MUST use the existing automation service in the same transaction. It MUST return the created rule and preserve existing history and worker semantics.

#### Scenario: Rule creation
- GIVEN an approved valid automation rule plan
- WHEN the tool executes
- THEN the existing service persists and audits the rule in the request transaction and returns it as evidence

#### Scenario: Unapproved write
- GIVEN a plan to create an automation without valid approval
- WHEN the assistant reaches execution
- THEN no rule or domain event is created

### Requirement: AT-3 — Bounded Web Evidence

Web search MUST use one bounded adapter interface over `httpx` and return source evidence. Tavily and other external integrations MUST NOT be required by this capability.

#### Scenario: Search result
- GIVEN an authorized read plan containing a web query
- WHEN web search completes
- THEN bounded results and source references are returned as evidence

#### Scenario: Search failure
- GIVEN a timeout, malformed response, or unsafe result
- WHEN the adapter runs
- THEN the tool returns a testable error evidence state and performs no domain mutation
